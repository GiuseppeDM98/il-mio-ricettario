/**
 * SeasonSelector Component - Multi-Select Season Picker
 *
 * MIGRATION FROM SINGLE TO MULTIPLE SEASONS:
 * Previously used mutually exclusive button selection (one season only).
 * Now supports selecting multiple seasons via toggle buttons.
 *
 * USER INTERACTION:
 * - Click season button: Toggle in/out of selection
 * - Can select 0 to 5 seasons (no maximum enforced)
 * - Visual feedback: Selected buttons use primary color with shadow/scale
 * - Counter shows "N stagione/i selezionate" below buttons
 *
 * WHY MULTI-SELECT:
 * Italian recipes often span multiple seasons (e.g., Pasta e Fagioli
 * is both autunno + inverno). Single season selection was too restrictive.
