# Release Notes - January 2026

## What's New

### 🔍 Recipe Search
Search your recipes by name directly from the recipes page. The search supports Italian characters (à, è, ì, ò, ù) and works seamlessly with existing season and category filters.

**Features:**
- Fast, real-time search as you type
- Works with Italian accented characters
- Combines with season and category filters for refined results
- Shows result count and clear button for convenience

### 🌸☀️🍂❄️ Multiple Seasons per Recipe
You can now assign multiple seasons to a single recipe! Perfect for dishes that work well across different times of year, like Pasta e Fagioli (autumn + winter).

**Features:**
- Select one or more seasons when creating or editing recipes
- Recipe cards display all assigned season badges
- Filter view shows recipes for each selected season
- Existing recipes automatically migrate when edited

### 📱 Apple Home Screen Icon
When adding Il Mio Ricettario to your iPad home screen, you'll now see the custom recipe book icon instead of a generic screenshot.

## Improvements

- **Centralized Season Management**: Season labels and icons are now consistent across the entire application
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing recipes with single seasons continue to work perfectly during the transition
- **Italian Character Support**: All text search functions now properly handle Italian diacritics
