## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] **GitHub account** - For version control and deployment integration
- [ ] **Vercel account** (free tier sufficient) - For hosting the application
- [ ] **Firebase account** (free tier sufficient) - For authentication and database
- [ ] **Anthropic account with API key** - For AI recipe extraction features
- [ ] **Node.js 18+** installed locally - For testing before deployment
- [ ] **Firebase CLI** installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g firebase-tools
  ```

**Time Estimate**: 20-30 minutes for complete setup

---

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

**Best for**: Most users, especially those new to deployment

**Advantages**:
- Zero-configuration Next.js deployment
- Automatic HTTPS certificates and global CDN
- Serverless functions for API routes (no server management needed)
- Environment variable management through dashboard
- Git integration (automatic deployments on push to main)
- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth/month, unlimited projects

**Limitations**:
- 4.4MB request body limit (affects maximum PDF upload size)
- 10-second serverless function timeout on free tier
- Vendor lock-in to Vercel platform

**When to choose**: Default choice for most deployments

---

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting

**Best for**: Users who want everything on Firebase, or need static hosting

**Advantages**:
- Same provider as Firestore backend (single dashboard)
- Free tier: 10GB storage, 360MB/day transfer
- Custom domains with automatic SSL
- SPA-friendly hosting

**Limitations**:
- Static export only (no server-side rendering)
- API routes require Cloud Functions setup (additional complexity)
- AI extraction features need extra configuration
- Build-time environment variables only

**When to choose**: You prefer Firebase's ecosystem or want a fully static site

---

**Recommendation**: Use Vercel for full functionality with minimal setup. This guide focuses on Vercel deployment first, with Firebase Hosting as an alternative at the end.

---

## Firebase Setup

Firebase provides authentication and database services for the application. Complete this setup regardless of which deployment option you choose.

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "**Add project**" or "Create a project"
3. **Project name**: Enter a name (e.g., `my-recipe-book-prod`)
4. **Google Analytics**: Optional (recommended for tracking)
5. Click "**Create project**" and wait ~30 seconds for initialization

**Verification**: You should see the Firebase project dashboard with "Get started" options

---

### Step 2: Enable Authentication

1. In the Firebase Console sidebar, click **Authentication**
2. Click "**Get started**"
3. Go to the "**Sign-in method**" tab

**Enable Email/Password Authentication**:
1. Click "**Email/Password**"
2. Toggle the first switch (Email/Password) to **Enabled**
3. Leave "Email link" disabled (optional feature)
4. Click "**Save**"

**Enable Google Sign-In**:
1. Click "**Google**" provider
2. Toggle to **Enabled**
3. **Project support email**: Select your email from dropdown
4. **Project public-facing name**: (Auto-filled, leave as is)
5. Click "**Save**"

**Verification**:
- Both "Email/Password" and "Google" should show green "Enabled" status
- You should see these providers in the sign-in method list

---

### Step 3: Create Firestore Database

1. In the sidebar, click **Firestore Database**
2. Click "**Create database**"

**Security Rules**:
- Select "**Start in production mode**"
- (We'll deploy custom rules in the next step)

**Location**:
Choose the closest region to your primary users:
- **Europe**: `eur3` (Belgium) or `europe-west1` (Belgium)
- **United States**: `us-central` (Iowa) or `us-east1` (South Carolina)
- **Asia**: `asia-southeast1` (Singapore) or `asia-northeast1` (Tokyo)

**Important**: Location cannot be changed after creation!

3. Click "**Enable**"
4. Wait ~1 minute for database creation

**Verification**: Empty Firestore console appears with "Start collection" option

---

### Step 4: Deploy Firestore Security Rules

The project includes owner-based security rules that ensure users can only access their own data.

**Clone the Repository** (if not already done):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiuseppeDM98/il-mio-ricettario.git
cd il-mio-ricettario
```

**Login to Firebase**:
```bash
firebase login
```
- Opens browser for authentication
- Allow Firebase CLI to access your account
- Return to terminal when authenticated

**Link Your Project**:
```bash
firebase use --add
```
- Select your Firebase project from the list
- **Alias name**: Enter `default` (or custom name)
- Confirms: "Now using alias default"

**Deploy Security Rules**:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Expected Output**:
```
=== Deploying to 'your-project-name'...

i  deploying firestore
i  firestore: reading rules from firebase/firestore.rules...
✔  firestore: rules file firebase/firestore.rules compiled successfully
✔  firestore: released rules firestore.rules to cloud.firestore

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/...
```

**Verification**:
1. Go to Firebase Console → **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
2. You should see rules with functions:
   - `isAuthenticated()` - Checks if user is logged in
   - `isOwner(userId)` - Verifies user owns the data
3. Rules enforce `userId` on all collections

---

### Step 5: Get Firebase Configuration

1. In Firebase Console, click the **gear icon ⚙️** → **Project settings**
2. Scroll to "**Your apps**" section
3. If you don't have a web app registered yet:
   - Click the web icon **`</>`**
   - **App nickname**: "Il Mio Ricettario Web"
   - **Don't** check "Also set up Firebase Hosting"
   - Click "**Register app**"
4. You'll see a `firebaseConfig` object:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyC...",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789012",
  appId: "1:123456789012:web:abcdef123456"
};
```

**Copy all 6 values** - you'll need them when configuring environment variables in Vercel.

**Security Note**: These values are safe to expose in client-side code (they're `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables). Security is enforced by Firestore rules, not by hiding these values.

---

### Step 6: Configure Authorized Domains (Post-Deployment)

**Important**: Complete this step AFTER deploying to Vercel in Step 7 below.

After you have your Vercel deployment URL:

1. Return to Firebase Console → **Authentication** → **Settings**
2. Click "**Authorized domains**" tab
3. By default, only `localhost` and `*.firebaseapp.com` are authorized
4. Click "**Add domain**"
5. Enter your Vercel deployment URL (without `https://`):
   - Example: `il-mio-ricettario-abc123.vercel.app`
6. Click "**Add**"

**If using a custom domain**, add it here as well:
- Example: `recipes.yourdomain.com`

**Without this step**, authentication will fail with "Unauthorized domain" errors on your deployed app.

---

## Anthropic API Setup

Anthropic's Claude AI powers the PDF recipe extraction feature.

### Step 1: Create Anthropic Account

1. Go to [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Click "**Sign Up**"
3. Verify your email address
4. (Optional) Add billing information
   - New accounts get **$5 in free credits**
   - Pay-as-you-go: ~$0.05-$0.15 per PDF extraction (10-20 recipes)

---

### Step 2: Create API Key

1. In Anthropic Console, navigate to **API Keys** section (left sidebar)
2. Click "**Create Key**"
3. **Name**: "Il Mio Ricettario Production"
4. Click "**Create**"
5. **Copy the API key immediately** - it's only shown once!
   - Format: `sk-ant-api03-...`

**Save this key securely** - you'll add it to Vercel environment variables.

---

### Pricing Reference

**Claude Sonnet 4.5** pricing (as of January 2026):

- Free tier covers ~30-100 PDFs

---

## Vercel Deployment

Deploy the Next.js application to Vercel.

### Step 1: Prepare Repository

Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub:

```bash
cd il-mio-ricettario
git status                        # Check for uncommitted changes
git add .                         # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Prepare for production deployment"
git push origin main              # Push to GitHub
```

**Verification**: Visit your GitHub repository - latest commit should appear

---

### Step 2: Create Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
2. Click "**Sign Up**"
3. Choose "**Continue with GitHub**"
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub account
5. Select which repositories Vercel can access:
   - **Recommended**: "Only select repositories" → Select `il-mio-ricettario`
   - Alternative: "All repositories" (not recommended for security)

**Verification**: You should see the Vercel dashboard

---

### Step 3: Import Project

1. In Vercel Dashboard, click "**Add New...**" → "**Project**"
2. **Import Git Repository**: Find `il-mio-ricettario` in the list
3. Click "**Import**"

**Project Configuration** (auto-detected):
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js ✓
- **Root Directory**: `./`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

**Important**: Don't deploy yet! We need to add environment variables first.

---

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

In the "**Environment Variables**" section, add all 8 variables:

**Firebase Variables** (from Firebase Setup - Step 5):

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | `AIzaSyC...` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | `your-project.firebaseapp.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | `your-project-id` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | `your-project.appspot.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | `123456789012` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | `1:123456789012:web:abcdef` |

**Anthropic Variable** (from Anthropic Setup - Step 2):

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `sk-ant-api03-...` |

**Optional Toggle**:

| Name | Value | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRATIONS_ENABLED` | `true` or `false` | Enable/disable new user registrations |

**For each variable**:
1. Enter the **Name** exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
2. Paste the **Value**
3. Select all environments: **Production**, **Preview**, **Development**
4. Click "Add"

**Critical Notes**:
- Double-check spelling (especially `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` does NOT have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix (server-only)
- No quotes around values

---

### Step 5: Deploy

1. After adding all environment variables, click "**Deploy**"
2. Vercel will:
   - Install dependencies (~1 minute)
   - Build the application (~2 minutes)
   - Deploy to global CDN (~1 minute)

**Build Process**:
```
Running "npm run build"
> next build

Linting and checking validity of types...
✓ Linting and checking types complete
Creating an optimized production build...
✓ Compiled successfully

Uploading build outputs...
✓ Build complete

Deployment ready!
```

**Deployment Time**: 2-5 minutes total

---

### Step 6: Get Deployment URL

After successful deployment:

1. Vercel shows "**Congratulations!**" screen
2. Copy your deployment URL:
   - Format: `https://il-mio-ricettario-[random-id].vercel.app`
   - Example: `https://il-mio-ricettario-7xk2p9m1.vercel.app`

**Save this URL** - you need it for Firebase authorized domains (next step)

---

### Step 7: Authorize Vercel Domain in Firebase

**Return to Firebase Setup - Step 6** (if not already completed):

1. Firebase Console → **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Authorized domains**
2. Click "**Add domain**"
3. Enter your Vercel URL (without `https://`):
   - Example: `il-mio-ricettario-7xk2p9m1.vercel.app`
4. Click "**Add**"

**Verification**: Domain should appear in the authorized list

---

### Step 8: Test Deployment

Open your Vercel URL in a browser and verify:

**Basic Functionality**:
- [ ] Login page loads without errors
- [ ] Can register a new account (if `NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRATIONS_ENABLED=true`)
- [ ] Can login with email/password
- [ ] Can logout

**Google Sign-In** (should now work after adding authorized domain):
- [ ] Click "Sign in with Google"
- [ ] Select Google account
- [ ] Redirects back to app successfully
- [ ] User is logged in

**Recipe Management**:
- [ ] Can create a recipe manually
- [ ] Recipe appears in list
- [ ] Can edit recipe
- [ ] Can delete recipe

**PDF Extraction** (if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` configured):
- [ ] Navigate to "Estrattore Ricette"
- [ ] Upload a small test PDF (< 1MB)
- [ ] Wait 15-60 seconds for extraction
- [ ] Recipes appear in preview
- [ ] Can save extracted recipes

**If any tests fail**, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

---

### Step 9: Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain instead of `.vercel.app`:

1. In Vercel Dashboard, go to your project → **Settings** → **Domains**
2. Click "**Add**"
3. Enter your domain:
   - Example: `recipes.yourdomain.com`
   - Or apex domain: `yourdomain.com`
4. Vercel provides DNS configuration instructions

**DNS Configuration** (at your domain provider):

**For subdomain** (`recipes.yourdomain.com`):
| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | recipes | cname.vercel-dns.com |

**For apex domain** (`yourdomain.com`):
| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| A | @ | 76.76.21.21 |

5. Wait for DNS propagation (5 minutes - 48 hours)
6. Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificate

**After DNS propagates**:
- Add custom domain to Firebase authorized domains (Step 7)
- Test authentication flow on custom domain

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

## Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues and solutions.

### Build Fails on Vercel

**Symptom**:
- Deployment status shows "Failed"
- Build logs show TypeScript errors or module not found

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify build works locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Fix any errors before pushing

2. **Check TypeScript errors**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
   Resolve type errors

3. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/node@latest @types/react@latest
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Clear Vercel cache**:
   - Redeploy with "Force rebuild" option

---

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptom**:
- App works locally but fails on Vercel
- Firebase auth errors
- "API key not configured" messages

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify all variables are set**:
   - Vercel Dashboard → Settings → **Environment Variables**
   - Check all 8 variables are present

2. **Check variable spelling**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` (not `FIREBASE_API_KEY`)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

3. **Verify environment selection**:
   - Each variable should be enabled for: Production, Preview, Development

4. **Redeploy after changes**:
   - Environment variable changes require redeployment
   - Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → "..." → Redeploy

---

### Google Sign-In Fails

**Symptom**:
- Error: "redirect_uri_mismatch"
- Error: "This domain is not authorized"

**Solutions**:

1. **Add domain to Firebase authorized domains**:
   - Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
   - Add your Vercel URL: `your-app.vercel.app`

2. **Wait for propagation**:
   - Changes may take 5-10 minutes to take effect

3. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Try incognito mode

4. **Check OAuth consent screen**:
   - Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method → Google
   - Ensure project support email is set

---

### PDF Extraction Not Working

**Symptom**:
- "API key not configured" error
- Extraction times out
- "Request failed" errors

**Solutions**:

**For API key errors**:
1. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables
2. Ensure it does NOT have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
3. Check API key is active in Anthropic Console
4. Verify account has available credits

**For timeouts**:
1. Try smaller PDF first (< 1MB, 1-5 recipes)
2. Check Vercel function logs for detailed error
3. Large PDFs (> 3MB) may hit 10s timeout on free tier
4. Consider upgrading to Vercel Pro for 60s timeouts

**For file size errors**:
1. Compress PDF using [iLovePDF](https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf)
2. Split large PDFs into smaller files
3. 4.4MB is hard limit (Vercel request body size)

---

### Firestore Permission Denied

**Symptom**:
- Error: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
- Queries fail after deployment
- Can't read/write recipes

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify security rules are deployed**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Check rules in Firebase Console**:
   - Firestore Database → Rules tab
   - Verify `isAuthenticated()` and `isOwner()` functions exist

3. **Verify queries filter by userId**:
   ```typescript
   // In your code
   query(recipesRef, where('userId', '==', userId))
   ```

4. **Test with Firebase Rules Simulator**:
   - Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → Simulator
   - Test read/write operations

---

### Mobile Navigation Broken

**Symptom**:
- Bottom nav shows on desktop
- Sidebar shows on mobile
- Navigation disappears on rotation

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify Tailwind breakpoint**:
   ```javascript
   // tailwind.config.ts
   lg: '1440px'  // Must be custom value
   ```

2. **Check responsive classes**:
   ```typescript
   // Use max-lg:portrait: not just portrait:
   className="max-lg:portrait:block lg:hidden"
   ```

3. **Clear Vercel cache and redeploy**

4. **Test in different browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

---

## Alternative: Firebase Hosting

Deploy to Firebase Hosting instead of Vercel.

### Limitations

**Important Limitations**:
- Static export only (no server-side rendering)
- API routes (`/api/extract-recipes`, `/api/suggest-category`) **will not work**
- AI extraction features require Cloud Functions setup (not covered here)
- Build-time environment variables only

**Recommendation**: Use this only if you don't need AI features or if you're willing to set up Cloud Functions separately.

---

### Step 1: Modify Next.js Config

Edit `next.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',  // Changed from 'standalone'
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  // Remove redirects - not supported in static export
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

---

### Step 2: Build Static Export

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in `/out` directory.

**Verification**: Check that `/out` folder exists and contains `index.html`

---

### Step 3: Initialize Firebase Hosting

```bash
firebase init hosting
```

**Configuration**:
- **Public directory**: Enter `out`
- **Configure as single-page app**: Enter `Yes`
- **Set up automatic builds with GitHub**: Enter `No` (for now)
- **Overwrite index.html**: Enter `No`

**Generated files**:
- `firebase.json` - Hosting configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Project aliases

---

### Step 4: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Output**:
```
=== Deploying to 'your-project'...

i  deploying hosting
i  hosting[your-project]: beginning deploy...
✔  hosting[your-project]: file upload complete
✔  hosting[your-project]: version finalized
✔  hosting[your-project]: release complete

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-project.web.app
```

---

### Step 5: Test Deployment

Open `https://your-project.web.app`:

**Working Features**:
- [ ] Login page loads
- [ ] Authentication works (email/password + Google)
- [ ] Can create recipes manually
- [ ] Cooking mode works

**Not Working**:
- [ ] PDF extraction (requires Cloud Functions)
- [ ] AI category suggestions (requires Cloud Functions)

---

### Step 6: Custom Domain (Firebase)

1. Firebase Console → **Hosting** → Click your site
2. Click "**Add custom domain**"
3. Enter your domain: `recipes.yourdomain.com`
4. **Verify ownership**:
   - Add TXT record to your DNS:
     ```
     TXT @ firebase=[random-value]
     ```
5. **Add A records** (provided by Firebase):
   ```
   A @ [IP-address-1]
   A @ [IP-address-2]
   ```
6. Wait for DNS propagation (5 min - 48 hours)
7. Firebase auto-provisions SSL certificate

## Advanced Configuration

### Performance Optimization

**Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`):

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "functions": {
    "api/extract-recipes.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 60,
      "memory": 1024
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Increase function timeout to 60s (requires Vercel Pro)
- Allocate more memory for large PDF processing

---

### Security Headers

Add security headers in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
          "value": "1; mode=block"
        },
        {
          "key": "Referrer-Policy",
          "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Firebase App Check (Optional)

Protect Firebase backend from abuse:

1. Firebase Console → **App Check**
2. Click "**Get started**"
3. Select platform: **Web**
4. **reCAPTCHA provider**:
   - Register at [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
   - Get site key
   - Add to Firebase App Check
5. **Enforcement**: Start with "Unenforced" (monitoring only)
6. After testing, switch to "Enforced"

**Benefits**:
- Prevents API abuse
- Blocks bots and scrapers
- No impact on legitimate users
